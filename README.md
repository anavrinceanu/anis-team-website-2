# anis-team-website-2

Website 2 made during the competition "Progressio 2021" by Ana Vr√Ænceanu and Denis Drezyulya.

This website was made in only 7 hours during the competition "Progressio 2021". At the beginning of the day we were assigned a theme and a topic in order to create a website. The theme was "Everybody's Enemy Elan" and the topic was that the recent multibillionaire Elan Mask replaced all of his workers with robots and we had to keep these unemployed geniuses productive and sane through this website.
